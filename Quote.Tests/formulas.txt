Compound Interest Formulas and Calculations:

Calculate Accrued Amount (Principal + Interest)
A = P(1 + r/n)nt

Calculate Principal Amount, solve for P
P = A / (1 + r/n)nt

Calculate rate of interest in decimal, solve for r
r = n[(A/P)1/nt - 1]

Calculate rate of interest in percent
R = r * 100

Calculate time, solve for t
t = ln(A/P) / n[ln(1 + r/n)] = [ ln(A) - ln(P) ] / n[ln(1 + r/n)]
